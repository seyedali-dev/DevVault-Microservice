## Introduction

DevVault is a **comprehensive project management application** built using **Spring Boot** and **microservices architecture**. It provides a **seamless experience** for project leaders and team members to **collaborate effectively**. With DevVault, you can register users, create projects, manage project members, create tasks, and assign tasks to team members.

## Functionalities

🚀 DevVault offers the following **key functionalities**:

1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register and log in using JWT tokens for **secure access**. ✅

2. **Project Creation**: Users can create new projects, becoming the **project leader** in the process. 🏗️

3. **Adding Members to Projects**: Project leaders can add members to their projects and specify their roles as project admins or team members. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

4. **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks within projects, enabling **structured project management**. 📋

5. **Task Assignment**: Project leaders can assign tasks to specific project members. 📌

6. **Task Progress Tracking**: Users can mark tasks as completed, keeping everyone informed about project progress. ✔️

7. **Project and Task Comments**: Users can comment on projects and tasks, fostering **collaboration** and **communication** among team members. 💬

## Technologies Used

💻 DevVault leverages several **cutting-edge technologies** and microservices:

| Technology             | Description                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Spring Boot            | The foundation for building microservices.| 🌱
| JWT Authentication     | Secure user registration and login.      | 🔒
| Feign Client           | Service communication between microservices.| 📡
| Eureka Service Registry| For service discovery.                   | 🕵️
| Netflix Zuul API Gateway| Routes requests and applies filters.   | 🌐
| Config Server          | Manages configuration properties.         | ⚙️
| Shared Library         | Reusable classes for multiple services.   | 📚

## Project Structure

🏢 DevVault is organized into microservices, promoting **modularity** and **maintainability**:

├── authentication-service/
│
├── project-service/
│
├── task-service/

├── comment-service/
│
├── config-server/
│
└── shared-lib/ (This service contains DTOs, Exceptions, Enums, Requests, Response Classes that are used across multiple microservices.)
```

## Security Implementation

🔐 **Security** is a top priority in DevVault. Here's how it works:

1. When a user makes a request, it goes through the **API Gateway filter**. 🚧

2. The API Gateway filter redirects the request to the **Authentication Service**. 🔄

3. Upon successful login, a **JWT token** is applied to the API Gateway filter, granting access. 🌟

## Lessons Learned

🧠 Through the development of DevVault, I've gained valuable insights and expertise, including:

- Proficiency in **Spring Boot** and **microservices architecture**. 💪
- Implementation of secure user authentication with **JWT**. 🔐
- Effective communication between microservices using **Feign Client**. 📡
- Service discovery with **Eureka** and routing with **Zuul API Gateway**. 🌐
